ORC-OS has several settings pages. To access any of these, click in the top-right of the navigation bar on |settings_icon|.
This will reveal the following settings options:

* Daemon settings
* Disk management settings
* Water level settings
* Set up LiveORC link
* Updates

The available settings are elaborately described in the next sections.

.. note::

    The daemon settings requires a finalized :ref:`Video Configuration <video_conf_intro>`. We recommend first reading that section before
    reading on Daemon settings.
