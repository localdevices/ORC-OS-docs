Suitable site conditions
------------------------
Some notes on site suitability are required before deciding if image-based discharge measurements will work for your
case. We list these here and give examples of suitable as well as less suitable sites.

Conditions that you should look for although "ideal" sites almost never exist.

1. Look for a "uniform" site. This means that water can freely flow under a significant energy slope, without
   significant influence of downstream or upstream structures. This is to ensure that relatively simple assumptions
   how surface velocity translates to depth-average velocity are valid.
2. Significant moving structures should be visible at the surface during the conditions that you want to be able to
   measure. If water movements cannot be detected ORC-OS also will not be able to estimate it.
3. Consider that velocities under 0.1 meter per second are likely to be difficult to detect.
4. A suitable location to place a camera, such that it can oversee the entire width at an angle of at least 10
   degrees. Roughly, for every 10 meters distance, you will need a 1.5 to 2 meter elevation to achieve this.
   The middle of a bridge may seem attractive but is in many conditions NOT suitable as you then have to look quite
   far away in the objective to see the entire width and then the angle is too small. Better locations are either left
   or right bank, looking towards the other shore from a high enough elevation, e.g. the natural levee, or on top of a
   mast. The left or right side of a bridge head, looking towards the other side can sometimes work.
5. A safe location from any surrounding environmental threads, including but not limited to floods, vandalism, wildlife
   and so on. In urban environments look for a wall perimeter to place the installation on or behind. Consider fencing
   to protect against large mammal wildlife and monkeys. Also be aware that seasonal rivers with very large differences
   between low and high flow conditions may be unsafe at sharp outerbanks, as these typically erode fast during events.
   Also consider your own safety while installing, before going into the field.

.. note::

   If under high flow conditions, you do not see the entire width, the flow will still be estimated. ORC-OS has
   routines that use the existing observed surface velocities, combined with the cross section profile to estimate
   velocities in areas on the cross section that are beyond the field of view of the camera. Make sure that you always
   measure an as complete as possible cross section from left to right bank or natural levee, even if part of that
   cross section is not visible in the camera's field of view.
