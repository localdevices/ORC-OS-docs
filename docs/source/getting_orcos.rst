Getting ORC-OS
==============

Raspberry Pi images

Rainbow Sensing, the company behind this entirely Open-Source software framework, provide ready-to-use images
solely for use on Raspberry Pi systems, with one year of support for a fixed fee.
After the first year you may continue using the software on your own devices
indefinitely and decide for extension of the support contract. See https://openrivercam.org/ for more information.

After obtaining and image (``.img.gz`` file), you may install it on a Raspberry Pi device by following the installation

Please do not contact us for support on installation if you do an installation without an obtained ``.img`` file.
