Over-The-Air updates
--------------------
ORC-OS has its own OTA update system. If an update is available, at this page you will see
- your current ORC-OS version
- whether an update is available (with the version number)
- a description of the last changes provided by the update

.. note::

    Currently, our OTA system does not yet check if your system fulfills the right requirements. We may in the future
    add checks on:
    - Minimum previous version of ORC-OS.
    - Minimum python version required
    - Minimum available packages (with indication that these should first be installed)

To update, just click on the update button and check the progress on the page. Do not refresh during this
process. If the update is finished the back-end will restart automatically. After that, we recommend to
perform a full refresh of the web interface by pressing ``Ctrl+Shift+R``.
